            <p>Hello there! Welcome to my website, My name is Crystal James, formerly known as Dr. Crystal James. I would have gradudated from the University of the West Indies in 2020 and pursued my Internship at the Port of Spain General Hospital initally, following which, I sought to take some time off, then resumed in Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex.</p>

            <p>Throughout my time there i would have grown to love educating those around me especially young medical students, which prompted me to leave the medical pathway and seek to puruse teaching as a bright and more vibrant and personally fulfilling career path. </p>

            <p>My specialties includes Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics</p>

            <p>Feel free to reach out to me via the <li><a href="../html/contact.html">Contact</a></li> page for any inquiries</p>
